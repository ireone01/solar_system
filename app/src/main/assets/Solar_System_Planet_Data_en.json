    "additional_info": "The Sun, also known as the 'ruler' of the Solar System, accounts for over 99% of its total mass. Its continuous solar winds significantly affect asteroids and the magnetospheres of planets. The Sun is roughly at mid-life and will continue to burn for over 5 billion years before evolving into a red giant.",
    "structure": "About three-quarters of the Sun’s mass is hydrogen, with helium making up most of the remainder. A small fraction (around 1.69%) consists of heavier elements such as carbon, neon, iron, and oxygen. The Sun is divided into layers: the core, the radiative zone, the convective zone, and the photosphere (the visible 'surface').",
    "distance": "The average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 149.6 million km (1 astronomical unit). Sunlight takes around 8 minutes and 19 seconds to reach Earth, providing essential energy for life.",
    "in_milky_way": "The Sun is located on the inner edge of the Orion Arm of the Milky Way, about 26,000 light-years from the galactic center. Although not exceptionally large compared to many stars, it still outshines about 85% of the stars in our galaxy."
